Running the Hello World App
===========================

If you've succesfully installed SBT, this should be trivial

 * `cd` into the directory
 * Run `sbt run`

Using the Scala REPL
--------------------

If you're in a directory with an SBT project, you can also use the Scala REPL:

 * Run `sbt`
 * Enter `console`, this should get you in the REPL
 * Type something like `1 + 2`
 * There's suggestions: try `5.<tab>` (replace <tab> with the tab key...)
