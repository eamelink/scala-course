Installing Scala-IDE
====================

Download Eclipse
----------------

 * Download a suitable [Eclipse Indigo for your OS](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/indigo/sr2) The Java EE version should be fine.

Install Scala-IDE Plugin
------------------------

 * Add the [Scala IDE Milestone Ecosystem update site](http://download.scala-ide.org/ecosystem/dev-milestone-2.9/site/)
 * Install from this update site 
   - Scala IDE for Eclipse
   - Scala Worksheet
 * After restart, the 'Setup Diagnostics' window will probably pop up (if not, it's in the menu: Scala -> Run Setup Diagnostics), which will inform you that you should upgrade your heap space. Follow the instructions for that.
